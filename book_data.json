    "bookDescription": "In the best tradition of Christmas stories, Father Christmas Adventures provides a celebration of the festive season, while also critiquing contemporary society. Consisting of three short tales, all involving Father Christmas, this book delivers fables with unexpected twists and encounters, resulting in a degree of novelty that is rarely seen in this genre of fiction. Starting with a light-hearted account of what happens to parents who do not believe in Father Christmas, the book then offers a story where Father Christmas shows his concern for humanity's often damaging attitudes towards the natural world. Both tales hint at darker forces at work in the world, but this darkness comes to the fore in the final story, which cleverly links Father Christmas to one of the wise men in the nativity, while also creating an entanglement with an earlier work by the author (A Father Christmas Story). Father Christmas Adventures is a festive season delight that will truly stir the Christmas spirit and leave the reader reflecting on the author's crystal clear message concerning the urgent need for all peoples of the Earth to re-engage in saving humanity from itself.",

Chandler. \"A long, long kiss, a kiss of youth and love.\" Byron. Morning was breaking over the landscape; a cool, refreshing breeze, laden with woodland sweets and wild birds' songs, softly kissed Mildred's cheek and awoke her. She started up with a low exclamation of delight, sprang to the open window, and kneeling there with her elbow on the sill and her cheek in her hand, feasted her eyes upon the beauty of the scene-a grand panorama of wooded hills, falling waters, wild glens and forests and craggy mountains, above whose lofty summits the east was glowing with crimson and gold. Another moment and the sun burst through the golden gate and began anew his daily round, \"rejoicing as a strong man to run a race.\"",

There was a fete in the parish and the innkeeper, Vasili Andreevich Brekhunov, a Second Guild merchant, being a church elder had to go to church, and had also to entertain his relatives and friends at home. But when the last of them had gone he at once began to prepare to drive over to see a neighbouring proprietor about a grove which he had been bargaining over for a long time. He was now in a hurry to start, lest buyers from the town might forestall him in making a profitable purchase. The youthful landowner was asking ten thousand rubles for the grove simply because Vasili Andreevich was offering seven thousand. Seven thousand was, however, only a third of its real value. Vasili Andreevich might perhaps have got it down to his own price, for the woods were in his district and he had a long-standing agreement with the other village dealers that no one should run up the price in another's district, but he had now learnt that some timber-dealers from town meant to bid for the Goryachkin grove, and he resolved to go at once and get the matter settled.",

Equality was published just before his death and was not received nearly as well as Looking Backward.Bellamy was born in 1850 in Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts. As a young man he studied law and entered the bar, but never practiced. He was a journalist and social theorist as well as a novelist. Bellamy's theory of public capitalism would greatly affect American political thought in the 20th century.",

The story begins halfway through the revolution, employing flashbacks and glimpses of the future to depict the lure of silver and its effects on men - corrupting and destroying some, revealing the strengths of others. Conrad's deep moral consciousness and masterful narrative technique are at their best in Nostromo, one of his greatest works. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked Nostromo 47th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. F. Scott Fitzgerald said, \"I'd rather have written Nostromo than any other novel.\"",

What is the proper punishment for a bookbinder who takes too long at his job? Are free libraries an unmixed blessing? More seriously: Can nothing make it worth our while not to quarrel with our fellows? Which is more desirable: memory or forgetfulness? Are we irrevocably cut off from the natural world, or might there still be a way back to it?",

    "bookDescription": "In the first book of this adult science-fiction thriller, a civil war erupts within humanity’s intergalactic republic, and a young soldier, alongside his lover, seeks revenge on the man who murdered his mother and joined the insurrectionists, his own father. What happens to your psychological state if you're Linked (joined in mental communion) with your mother as she's atomized from existence? Not too many people get to find out. Randal Scott is one of the unfortunate few, and he wouldn't wish that hell upon anyone. Who would? Randy enlists into the Commonwealth Defense Force (CDF) to deliver retribution to the man who killed his mother and mentally scarred him for life, his father, Arson Scott. After establishing a wonderful life for his family and nurturing his son into manhood, Arson mysteriously joined the insurgency that threatens to collapse humanity's intergalactic republic and partook in his wife's murder. Now Randy proceeds with deployment to Colony Four, where his father operates his insurgent faction. Alongside his lover and comrade, whom he shares a Link with, Stacie Spencer, Randy forges ahead with his quest to enact revenge. However, the path to vengeance is not a straightforward one for Randy. He becomes entangled in a web of violent conflict, lies, and conspiracies that have him questioning both of the combat forces in opposition, the CDF and the insurgency known as the Coalition of Rebel Factions. This character-driven science-fiction war story explores themes of rebellion, ethics and morality, classism, and revolution. It will appeal to fans of W.C. Bauers, William C. Dietz, David Weber, Nicholas Sansbury Smith, or simply readers looking for thought-provoking fiction that is rife with action and adventure!",

    "bookDescription": "A wonderfully powerful and interesting story of modern life and political intrigues in Washington, full of dramatic intensity and vivid portraiture. As a story of Washington life, dealing largely with what might be called social politics, it is certainly a success. As a society novel, it is indeed quite perfect; for while full justice is done to the frivolity and hollowncss of society, and to the fatal effect upon the sweetest and brightest natures of too much society, there is shown delicate appreciation of the fair and noble side of the social culture which both springs from and develops loftiness of nature and generosity of soul.",

When she later discovers that Darcy has deliberately turned another man against her beloved sister Jane, she resolves to have nothing more to do with him. In the comedy of manners that follows, Jane Austen portrays Elizabeth's prejudice toward a man who has resolved to be particularly careful to hide any sign of his admiration for her--with all of the consequent misunderstandings and entertaining reconciliations readers have come to expect from one of the finest British novelists.

There's a cart at the door.\" \"You don't say so!\" said Miss Dorcas, her elder sister, flying across the room to the window blinds, behind which Mrs. Betsey sat discreetly ensconced with her knitting work. \"Where? Jack, get down, sir!\" This last remark was addressed to a rough-coated Dandie Dinmont terrier, who had been winking in a half doze on a cushion at Miss Dorcas's feet. On the first suggestion that there was something to be looked at across the street, Jack had ticked briskly across the room, and now stood on his hind legs on an old embroidered chair, peering through the slats as industriously as if his opinion had been requested. \"Get down, sir!\" persisted Miss Dorcas. But Jack only winked contumaciously at Mrs. Betsey, whom he justly considered in the light of an ally, planted his toe nails more firmly in the embroidered chair-bottom, and stuck his nose further between the slats, while Mrs. Betsey took up for him, as he knew she would.",

    "bookPublishingDate": "20/4/2022, 12:00 AM",
    "bookDescription": "Broken Theory is a jettisoned collection of fragmentary writing, collected and collaged by new media artist, writer, musician, and theorist Alan Sondheim. Folding theoretical musings, text experiments, and personal confessions into a single textual flow, it examines the somatic foundations of philosophical theory and theorizing, discussing their relationships to the writer and body, and to the phenomenology of failure and fragility of philosophy's production. Writing remains writing, undercuts and corrects itself, is always superseded, always produced within an untoward and bespoke silo - not as an inconceivable last word, but instead a broken contribution to philosophical thinking. The book is based on fragmentation and collapse, displacing annihilation and wandering towards a form of \"roiling\" within which the text teeters on the verge of disintegration. In other words, the writing develops momentary scaffoldings - writing shored up by the very mechanisms that threaten its disappearance. Broken Theory is prefaced by a text from Maria Damon and followed by an extensive interview with art historian Ryan Whyte. Alan Sondheim is a new media artist, theorist, and writer concerned with the phenomenology of the virtual. He has collaborated with motion capture and virtual environment labs. His work is concerned with the inhabitation of the body in the virtual; with the textuality of the body; with the problematic of mixed reality and codework. His writing is known for its \"somatic grit\" and skeletal codes that partially appear within and determine the surface. This style embeds interferences among syntax, semantics, and formal systems. The textual body, body of text and writer, are deeply entangled. His current work is based on the psychogeography of real and virtual worlds and their modeling. Most recently he has focused on \"semantic ghosting\" - the body behind the virtual/symbolic body - and modes of viral dispersion in a series of videos and texts. Sondheim was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, attended Brown University, and has exhibited, taught, and lectured at a number of venues in the United States and abroad.",

    "bookPublishingDate": "2/11/2021, 12:00 AM",
    "bookDescription": "This is the most extensive selection in English of poems by one of the all-time great Dutch poets, Herman Gorter (1864-1927). A companion volume to M. Kruijff's translation of the epic May, this book welcomes the reader to the rich spectrum of Gorter's lyric verse. The selection traces the stages of Gorter's career as a poet. It opens with 22 poems from his introvertive 'sensitivist' Verses (Verzen, 1890) which have been called the beginning of modern Dutch poetry. These are followed by poems from later collections in which Gorter was transitioning to a less self- and more world-focused perspective. In the subsequent passages from the long epic Pan (1912/1916), he has clearly become a 'socialist' poet, albeit in a unique visionary sense. He is now pursuing a theme which will obsess him for the rest of his life: how to address the object of his love as both an individual woman and an incarnate summation of all humanity. The rest of the book comprises the first publication in English of Gorter's little-known last work Lyrics (Liedjes,1930). Haft's judicious abridgment reserves the structure, erotic themes, and lyric high points of this outstanding sequence which originally occupied three volumes. In Haft's version, Gorter sounds the way he should sound: musical and sensitive, at times groping, at other times jubilant, always sure of himself and amazing. For readers of English it will be a feast to be able to make his acquaintance via this translation. - Piet Gerbrandy, winner of the Herman Gorter Prize",

    "bookDescription": "One of the great heroines of American literature, Isabel Archer, journeys to Europe in order to, as Henry James writes in his 1908 Preface, \"affront her destiny.\" James began \"The Portrait of a Lady\" without a plot or subject, only the slim but provocative notion of a young woman taking control of her fate. The result is a richly imagined study of an American heiress who turns away her suitors in an effort to first establish--and then protect--her independence. But Isabel's pursuit of spiritual freedom collapses when she meets the captivating Gilbert Osmond. \"James's formidable powers of observation, his stance as a kind of bachelor recorder of human doings in which he is not involved,\" writes Hortense Calisher, \"make him a first-class documentarian, joining him to that great body of storytellers who amass what formal history cannot.\"",

    "bookDescription": "Lady Raytham drew aside the long velvet curtains and looked down into Berkeley Square. It was half-past four o'clock on a cheerless February evening. Rain and sleet were falling, and a thin yellow mist added to the gloom of the dying day. An interminable string of cars and taxi-cabs was turning towards Berkeley Street, their shining black roofs reflecting the glare of the overhead lights that had just then hissed and spluttered to life. She looked blankly towards the desolation of the gardens, a place of bare-limbed trees and shivering shrubs - stared, as though she expected to see some fog wraith take a definite and menacing shape, and give tangible form to the shadows that menaced reason and life.",
